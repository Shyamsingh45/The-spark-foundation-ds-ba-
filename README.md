**Prediction_Using_Supervised_ML**

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. 

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

OBJECTIVE-Clustering of Iris Dataset
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
ALGORITHM USED - K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

Workflow behind Implemention of K-Means Clustering

1.Choose the number of clusters k
2.Select k random points from the data as centroids
3.Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid
4.Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters
5.Repeat steps 3 and 4
